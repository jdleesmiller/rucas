== DESCRIPTION

The beginnings of a Computer Algebra System in ruby.
Supports basic simplification of symbolic expressions over the real numbers.
Expressions can be entered and manipulated using standard ruby.

This is at a very early stage; many things may change.

== SYNOPSIS

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rucas'

  include Rucas
<%
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rucas'
  require 'facets/string/word_wrap'
  include Rucas

  #
  # Return code (as string) and the resulting output (as string).
  # Make some effort to format nicely.
  #
  def x code
    # It's nice to put the erb line noise on its own line.
    code.sub! /^\n/, ''
    code.rstrip!
    return "" if code == ""

    output = eval(code).inspect

    # Try to be smart about respecting line widths.
    code_lines = code.lines.to_a
    indent = code_lines.map {|l| l =~ /^(\s+)/; $1}.min_by {|s| s.length}

    arrow = "#=> "
    output_col = 25
    max_width  = 80
    code_len = code_lines.last.length

    output_width = max_width - output_col - arrow.length - 1
    wrapped_output = output.word_wrap(output_width)
    wrapped_output = wrapped_output.take(1) +
      wrapped_output.drop(1).map {|l| " "*(arrow.length+1+output_col) + l}
    wrapped_output = wrapped_output.join.rstrip!
    start = code_lines.reverse.drop(1).reverse.join
    "#{start}%-#{output_col}s #{arrow}#{wrapped_output}" % code_lines.last
  end

  #  puts ((x + 1 - x)**y).simplify  # ==> 1
  #  puts (x + 1).with(x => 2).value # ==> 3
%>
  # basic algebraic simplification
<%=x %q{
  with_rucas {
    var :x
    var :y
    ((x + 1 - x)**y).simplify
  }.to_s
}%>

  # manipulate symbols using standard ruby code
<%=x %q{
  with_rucas {
    var :x
    var :y
    var :z
    foo = [x,y,z].inject {|s,e| s + e}
    foo ** 2
  }.to_s
}%>

  # build symbolics into ruby objects
<%=x %q{
  class Foo
    include Rucas::Symbolic
    def initialize
      var :p
      var :q
    end

    def bar
      (p + 1) / (q - p)
    end
  end
  Foo.new.bar.to_s
}%>

  # build expression trees
<%=x %q{
  with_rucas {
    var :p
    1 + p
  }
}%>

== NOTES

* Run an interactive session with the +rucas+ command; the interactive rucas is built on irb.
* The implementation is based on the source code for Norvig's Paradigms of AI Programming (PAIP), but rucas is not yet as complete as the macsyma in Norvig's book.

== PROBLEMS

* Simplification is quite dumb, because it doesn't understand much about commutativity and associativity.
* Doesn't do differentiation or integration (but could in the future).
* Doesn't support special functions (but could in the future).
* Doesn't integrate with other CAS systems (e.g. maxima) (but could in the future).
* Doesn't do anything with logical conditions on variables (e.g. x > 0).

== INSTALL

On *nix systems,

  sudo gem install rucas

should do it.

To run the interactive rucas, you should just be able to type +rucas+. If it doesn't work, you may need to change your PATH settings. The procedure for this is currently to run
  gem env
and look at the EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY; then run
  echo $PATH
and make sure that the executable directory is on your path. If it's not, you will have to add it (search for "add directory to path").
